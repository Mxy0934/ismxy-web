# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
# 控制工作流何时运行
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # 当主分支存在 push 或者 pull request请 求时触发任务
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # 允许, 从仓库的 Actions 选项卡手动运行当前工作流
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    # 作业运行的系统环境（运行时环境）
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # 步骤，表示完成该作业的一些列原子操作/步骤
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # 跳转到当前仓库的$GITHUB_WORKSPACE目录，以便访问仓库中的代码

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      # name 为步骤名称，run 为运行shell脚本
